IMDBPHP provides an API (Application Programmers Interface) to the movie information stored at the  IMDB.COM site. As this and the name suggests, it is primarily targeted at PHP programmers who want to extend their programs or their site with these movie information.

IMDBPHP2 is the second generation (drop-in replacement for IMDBPHP), and additionally supports  MoviePilot.
